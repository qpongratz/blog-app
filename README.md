# README

Created to learn about the basics of making a website through the MVC model with help from theodinproject.com
Live version hosted on Heroku at: https://enigmatic-garden-76205.herokuapp.com/

Learned:
-Got to feel my way around the various Rails systems including: basic models, basic controllers, basic views, partials to assist with views, concerns to assist models, how to add new columns to a model's database, various ways the rails conventions simplify code.

Next:
-Gain more familiarity with Rails
-Maybe eventually come back and spruce up the html and css on this app
